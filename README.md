This is application of various text classification techniques: 1. Naive Bayes Classifier 2. Linear Support Vector Machine 
3. Logistic Regression 4. Word2vec and Logistic Regression 5. Doc2vec and Logistic Regression 6. BOW with Keras
Each technique has been applied on a relatively large data set of Stack Overflow questions and tags.
